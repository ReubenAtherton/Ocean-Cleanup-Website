# Ocean-Cleanup-Website (Coursework)

An introduction to web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

We were tasked with replicating the design of a website given to us as a pdf, including the same information and features. With The Ocean Cleanup, there are various links and images as well as a working 'Plastic Footprint' calculator that uses JavaScript to handle the logic. 

With this project as a foundation to build from, I am excited to design and build more websites in the future!
